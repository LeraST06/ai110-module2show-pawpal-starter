# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

Three things a user needs to be able to do:
- Add their info and their pet (name, species, how much time they have per day)
- Add care tasks (walk, meds, grooming, etc.) with a duration and priority
- Generate a daily schedule that fits tasks into available time, highest priority first

Four classes:

**Owner** — name, available minutes per day; can add/get pets

**Pet** — name, species, linked to an owner; holds a list of tasks

**Task** — title, duration, priority (low/medium/high), optional preferred time, recurring flag; can return a numeric priority for sorting

**Scheduler** — takes a pet and builds the day's plan; sorts by priority, skips tasks that don't fit, explains what was scheduled and what wasn't

See [uml.md](uml.md) for the class diagram.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
